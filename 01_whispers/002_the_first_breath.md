### **The First Breath**  
*(Fragment from Echoes of the Wind—A mythic tale of humanity’s arrival, carried by the eternal wind that guides and tests all life.)*  

Before there were cities, before there were names,  
before the chimes rang their first song,  
there was only the **wind**.  

It swept across the twilight land, unseen but ever-moving,  
shaping stone, stirring dust, whispering secrets to the empty world.  
It had carried many things before—  
dust from the day’s burning edge,  
ice-breath from the frozen dark,  
but never had it carried voices.  

Then, one night, the wind turned,  
and from the sky, the strangers fell.  

They came wrapped in metal husks,  
silent in sleep, lost in the cold between the stars.  
The wind circled them, curious, testing, waiting.  
Would they rise, or would they scatter like sand?  

The first to wake did not yet know the world.  
Their lips cracked, their lungs burned,  
but when they gasped their first breath,  
they did not choke.  

For the wind had already claimed them.  

*"You have come where you were not meant to,"* it whispered.  
*"But here you are, and now you must learn."*  

Some listened. They watched how the trees bent but did not break,  
how the rivers carved their way through stone but never stopped flowing.  
They learned to follow the wind’s signs,  
to drink where it carried rain,  
to shelter when it howled with warning.  

And the wind, in turn, carried their voices,  
wove their words into its endless song.  

But some fought against it.  
They built walls too high, sealed doors too tight,  
shut out the whispering breath that had once cradled them.  
And the wind grew restless.  
It pressed against them,  
testing, warning, waiting.  
And when they did not yield, it came as a storm.  

For the wind does not suffer those who refuse to move.  

Those who listened, who bent like the trees,  
who shaped their lives as the rivers shaped stone,  
they remained.  
Their names became the first echoes in the land.  
Their hands built the first homes that the wind did not tear away.  
And the wind, in turn, carried their laughter,  
their stories, their legacies.  

And so it has been, and so it will be.  

For the wind is both test and teacher,  
both path and barrier,  
both guardian and destroyer.  

It does not promise safety,  
but it promises this:  

**Those who listen will endure.**  
**Those who yield will be carried forward.**  
**Those who fight the wind will be lost to it.**  

This is the law of the First Breath,  
the truth of the wind’s embrace.  

And still it whispers, for those who have ears to hear.
