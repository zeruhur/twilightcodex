### **The Prophecy of Starborne Winds**  
*(Wind-Chime Chronicles—A lyrical reinterpretation of ancient revelations as mythic prophecy.)*  

**Listen, wanderer, to the song of the winds,**  
for they were here before us, and they will remain when we are gone.  
They whisper of fire that fell from the sky,  
of steel-bound spirits that drifted in frozen sleep,  
of voices lost between the stars,  
seeking a home they never meant to find.  

**The wind remembers.**  

It knows the name *Horizon*, though no tongue now speaks it true.  
It knows the name *Wake*, though its bearer remains unseen.  
One vessel came to rest upon the twilight’s edge,  
its children woven into the breath of Duskara.  
But the other—  
The other sails still, or lies in silent ruin,  
waiting for ears that remember.  

**The wind warns.**  

What was lost may yet return,  
what was hidden may yet be found.  
Another voice calls through the storm,  
a brother, a shadow, a specter of the void.  
Will it bring kinship, or calamity?  
Will it claim what was left behind,  
or seek what was never meant to be taken?  

**The wind binds.**  

We are the echo of the ones before,  
woven now into this land, its dust upon our hands,  
its breath within our lungs.  
We are not only of Earth—we are of Duskara.  
Our footprints are traced in sand, our words carved in stone,  
but our stories are carried in the sky itself,  
whistling through the chimes, humming in the gale.  

**The wind will carry the answer.**  

And when it comes,  
we must be ready to listen.
