**Archivist’s Annotation—Cycle 872, Duskaran Accord Records**  

This fragment, extracted from a failing *Heirloom Crystal* unearthed near the ruins of the First City, raises more questions than it answers. It suggests that the *Stellar Horizon* was not a lone vessel, but one of at least two ships sent from Earth under a classified directive. The second vessel, *Pioneer’s Wake*, remains unaccounted for.  

The implication that it may have landed elsewhere on Duskara—or on another world entirely—introduces unsettling possibilities. If there are others, they may be unaware of our survival, just as we have long forgotten them.  

Or perhaps they did not survive at all.  

The last line of the recording lingers in the mind. *We were not meant to come alone.* If the second ship exists, does it still watch the skies as we do? Do they seek us, as we now seek them?  

Or were they never meant to find us at all?
