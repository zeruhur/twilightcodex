### **The Eternal Wind’s Dance**  
*(Echoes of the Wind—A poetic fragment about "The Eternal Wind’s Dance," linking the calendar's cycles to spiritual beliefs and natural rhythms.)*  

*The wind is never still.*  
It moves as the sky breathes,  
it turns as the world turns,  
it sings where no voice dares rise.  

It is the hand that shapes the dunes,  
the whisper that bends the trees,  
the breath that lifts the wings of those who journey far.  
It is the drumbeat of time itself,  
marking the rise and fall of all things.  

**The First Wind comes swift,**  
rising from the heat-born edge,  
carrying the breath of fire and hunger,  
driving the storms that carve the land anew.  
It speaks of change, of motion,  
of things begun and things undone.  

**The Second Wind carries the rains,**  
falling gentle, falling strong,  
feeding the roots that grasp the stone,  
filling the rivers that weave through the land.  
It hums in the chimes,  
a song of patience, of waiting,  
of water held in careful hands.  

**The Third Wind hums with the cold,**  
curling from the dark-side’s embrace,  
a whisper of ice and shadow,  
a lullaby for the sleeping world.  
It slows the breath, stills the restless,  
teaches silence, teaches endurance,  
teaches the knowing of deep things.  

**And then the Last Wind comes,**  
twisting, turning, shifting between,  
a wind of balance, of endings and beginnings,  
a wind that carries all others within it.  
It does not belong to day or night,  
to heat or cold,  
but walks the line between,  
the way we do,  
the way we must.  

And so the wind turns,  
and so the cycles dance,  
and so we move with them,  
never still, never lost,  
but carried forward,  
as we have always been.
