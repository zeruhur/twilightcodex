### **The Psychic Wilds**  
*(Weatherworker’s Journal—Observations of Duskaran creatures’ unique adaptations and bonds with weatherworkers.)*  

**Entry 731 - Cycle 892**  

There are those who think the wind is indifferent, that it moves without mind or will. I know better.  

Today, I walked the stormpath near Zephyrvale’s outer ridges, where the land slopes toward the deep desert. The wind was heavy with dust, thick enough to mute sound and taste the iron of the earth. The kind of wind that carries secrets—if you know how to listen.  

I was not alone.  

The **driftwings** came first, gliding low over the dunes. I have long suspected they sense pressure shifts in ways beyond simple biology. Before I could feel the coming change in the air, they had already adjusted their flight paths, wings stiffening, movements precise. I reached out—not physically, but with the part of me that weatherworking awakens. A whisper of intent, a question without words.  

One slowed, circled. It was watching me as I watched it.  

Some believe these creatures bond with weatherworkers because of our resonance with the world, that they feel our minds stretch into the currents and respond in kind. I do not command them. I do not *tame* them. But I *understand* them, and that is enough.  

The driftwing veered sharply to the west. It was showing me something.  

**Entry 732 - Cycle 892**  

The driftwing led me to a sheltering rock formation, and beneath it, a dying **wind serpent** lay coiled.  

It had been struck—by a spear or by claws, I could not tell. The sand beneath it was dark with dried blood, its long body half-buried, as if it had tried to dig itself into safety and failed. It was breathing, but only just.  

I knelt beside it, pressing my hand to the earth. The air around it was thick—not just with heat, but with *something else*. A presence, a weight, pressing at the edges of my mind. **I had felt this before.**  

Some Duskaran creatures *speak* without words. Not with language, not with thought, but with something deeper—resonance, intention, an unspoken exchange of survival and warning. The wind serpent was trying to reach me, even as it lay dying.  

I focused, slow and careful. The connection was weak, flickering like a wind-tossed flame. A sensation, not quite an image—**fear, heat, hunger, the weight of the storm overhead.**  

It had been hunted. Not by another predator, but by something else.  

I had no medicine strong enough to save it, no power to mend wounds so deep. But I stayed with it as the winds shifted, my presence an answer to its final call. As the last breath left its body, the pressure around me faded, and the air grew still.  

The driftwing let out a keening cry and rose into the sky, circling once before vanishing into the storm.  

**Entry 733 - Cycle 892**  

I have long known that weatherworkers are not the only ones who hear the wind’s voice. The creatures of this world *listen*, just as we do. Some warn us of danger, others guide us toward safety.  

There are those who say psychic resonance is a gift unique to us, that only humans have the mind to reach into the currents of the world and pull meaning from the unseen. But I have felt the whisper of wind serpents in my bones. I have seen the way driftwings change their flight before a storm has even formed. I have watched **shadow lizards** move in perfect silence, sensing danger long before it arrives.  

They do not think as we do, but they *know*.  

And I wonder—do they look at us and think the same?  

Do they see us, stumbling through the wind, and wonder if we will ever learn to listen as well as they do?
