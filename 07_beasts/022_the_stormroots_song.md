### **The Stormroot’s Song**  
*(Echoes of the Wind—A mythic story about the creation of the Stormroot Tree, symbolizing resilience and adaptation.)*  

Before the first settlements, before the wind bore our names, there was only the storm.  

The sky roared without rest, and the land bowed beneath it, shifting, breaking, reshaping itself with every breath of the wind. Nothing grew, for nothing could stand long enough to take root. The wind did not care for what stayed still.  

But deep beneath the sand, where the world was quiet, something listened.  

It was not large, nor strong, nor old. It was a single seed, buried by chance, hidden from the storm’s fury. It could not see the sky, nor feel the wind’s touch, but it could hear. And so it waited, whispering to itself, listening to the way the world moved above.  

The wind spoke in howls and silence, in fury and stillness. And the seed learned.  

It did not reach upward, not yet—it sent its roots deep, past stone and sand, past the places the wind could touch. It drank from the waters unseen, fed on the heat that pulsed below. It did not fight the storm. It did not break as others had. It only listened.  

Seasons passed, though the sky did not change. When the seed had learned enough, when its roots were deep and its heart was strong, only then did it rise.  

A single branch pushed into the light.  

The wind, seeing something new, struck at it, tearing, bending, trying to break what had dared to reach. The branch did not resist. It swayed, bowed, let itself be shaped by the storm. And though it bent, it did not fall.  

The wind raged, testing, pushing harder.  

The branch grew thicker, its roots deeper, its limbs spreading, weaving into the air itself. It danced with the storm, let the wind move through it instead of against it.  

The wind watched. And for the first time, the wind changed.  

It curled around the branches, twisting through the gaps like a song played through hollow reed. And in return, the tree whispered back—**a voice in the storm, a sound never heard before.**  

And so, the storm listened.  

That is why, even now, the wind does not strike the Stormroot Trees as it does others. It moves through them, sings with them, carries their seeds far and wide.  

The Stormroot did not survive by standing against the storm.  
It survived by learning its rhythm.  

And so must we.
