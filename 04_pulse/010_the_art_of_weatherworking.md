### **The Art of Weatherworking**  
*(Weatherworker’s Journal—A vivid ritual description, its toll on the mind, and its spiritual undertones.)*  

**Entry 712 - Cycle 891**  

The wind does not bow, nor does it yield. It can be read, it can be followed, but it cannot be *tamed*. To practice weatherworking is not to control the air, but to *become part of it*—to listen, to guide, to offer a hand where the storm hesitates.  

Today, I performed the **Rite of Calling**, a ritual meant not to summon the wind, but to speak with it, to ask where it moves and why. The air was restless when I stepped onto the high ridge outside Zephyrvale. The twilight sky above was thick with slow-moving clouds, their undersides bruised with the warning of distant pressure shifts. I felt it before I even raised my hands—something was coming, something large, but it had not yet chosen its path.  

I knelt, pressing my palms to the stone, feeling the heat it still carried from the cycle before. The tools of the rite are simple: a tuning chime, a handful of dust, breath. I inhaled deeply, drawing in the dry scent of the air, and let my mind expand outward.  

Wind is not a single thing—it is layers, threads woven together from unseen currents. I reached for them, not with my hands, but with the part of me that is no longer simply flesh. The first pull was sharp, a burst of heat from the dayward edge. The second was sluggish, a cool weight sinking from the night side. The third—  

The third pulled back.  

There are moments when weatherworking ceases to feel like skill, and something older, deeper, takes hold. The wind does not always welcome our touch. Sometimes, it resists. Sometimes, it pushes *through* us.  

I kept my breath steady, grounding myself in the rhythm of the chime. With careful intent, I released the dust into the air, watching how it swirled, how it caught, where it faltered. And then I saw it—the shape of what was coming. A pressure wave, larger than I had anticipated, rolling slow and heavy toward the settlements. Not a storm, not yet, but if left unchecked, it would gather strength.  

I guided the current as best I could, adjusting my stance, aligning my will with the shifting flow. Not forcing, not demanding—just suggesting. The wind does not bow, but it listens. And tonight, it chose to hear me.

The ritual left its mark. It always does.  

Weatherworking is not without cost. The mind is not meant to stretch so far, to feel pressure shifts in the bones, to touch the sky and expect to return unchanged. Even now, hours later, my thoughts move sluggishly, my vision swims if I stand too quickly. My muscles ache—not from exertion, but from something deeper, something unseen.  

We call it **the Drain**, though some name it differently. The elders teach that it is the price of borrowing power too vast for human hands, a reminder that we were not *meant* to shape the wind, only to understand it. Others claim it is a simple biological strain, neurons firing in ways they were never meant to, burning through energy faster than the body can replenish. Perhaps both are true.  

I have seen what happens when one pushes too far. A weatherworker who loses themselves to the wind does not return the same. Some wake and find their senses dulled, the world too distant, too quiet. Some do not wake at all.  

And yet, we do it still.  

Not because we must, though we *must*. Not because the settlements depend on us, though they *do*. But because to be a weatherworker is to stand at the threshold of the unseen, to step where others cannot, to listen to something greater than ourselves.  

And sometimes, if we are lucky, it listens back.
