*(Fragment from Echoes of the Wind, as told by Lorekeeper Arath of Stillspire)*

In the beginning, there was a silence older than memory—a silence so profound it consumed light, swallowed sound, and held Duskara suspended between breath and stillness. The world lay dormant, her face turned half-toward the burning sky, her shadowed back a promise of mystery. And the wind—restless, eternal—stirred within this silence, a wandering spirit seeking stories to carry.

The wind is not a thing of gentleness, nor of cruelty. The wind simply is—a living memory, a breath that moves between worlds. It found the sky-singers—those great vessels of fire and steel—and sang to them not with words, but with a resonance that hummed through metal and spirit alike. A call that was both invitation and prophecy.

These ships descended like falling embers, silent as falling dreams. They brought the First Ones—our ancestors—pale as forgotten starlight, weary as the infinite journeys behind them. When they touched Duskara's twilight soil, the ships grew still, consumed by wind and earth, their hope transformed into something raw and immediate: survival.

The wind spoke then, and its voice was everywhere: "Listen, and you will live. Ignore me, and you will break."

It whispered of the Scorched Expanse and the Frozen Gloom, boundaries that promised death to the unwary. It tore through their fragile shelters, then softened to breathe cool promises across barren ground. The First Ones learned. They built, they fell, they rebuilt. Some cursed the wind as a thief of peace; others heard its deeper song and learned to dance with its rhythms.

There was a child in those early days—a child with twilight-colored eyes and a voice that carried on the breeze. The wind spoke directly to her, teaching secrets of silence and listening. She could stand motionless and hear the heartbeat of stone, the whispers of shifting sand, the unspoken pulse of the twilight itself.

Through her, humanity learned its first and most crucial lesson: to listen. Not just with ears, but with spirit. To hear the breath of Duskara itself.

"I am the breath of this world," the wind declared. "I will guide you, but I will not protect you. I will lift you, but I will not spare you."

These words became more than language. They became the very DNA of survival, etched into stone walls, woven into stories, carried across generations like a living pulse. The wind's many voices—the gentle nurturing breath, the destroying tempest, the silent revelation—all became part of their understanding.

And so the First Breath continues, an eternal melody carried by winds that never truly rest, a song that binds us to this twilight world—testing us, teaching us, defining us with each passing moment.
