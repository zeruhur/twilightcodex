*(Fragment from Echoes of the Wind, as told by Lorekeeper Arath of Stillspire)*  

Before the stars grew weary of watching, before the winds were heavy with memory, there was a silence—a silence so vast it drank the light and stilled the world. It is said that in this silence, Duskara slumbered, her face half-turned to the burning sky, her back cloaked in shadow. The wind, restless as always, stirred even then, searching for voices to carry. The silence was heavy and endless, a void that seemed to stretch into eternity, but the wind, ever patient, bided its time.  

It was in this search that the First Breath was born. The wind found the sky-singers—those great ships of fire and steel—and called out to them, weaving its song through their hollow hulls. The call was not one of words but of resonance, a hum that vibrated through the fabric of their vessels, beckoning them to descend. It is whispered that these ships answered not with sound but with descent, falling like embers into the twilight. They brought with them the First Ones, our ancestors, pale as frost and weary as the fading stars they left behind. These ships, once beacons of hope, grew silent as they touched the ground, consumed by the breath of the wind and the weight of the land.  

The wind, ever watchful, whispered to them as they stumbled onto the harsh soil of the Twilight Belt. “Listen,” it sang, “and I will teach you how to live. Ignore me, and I will break you.” For the wind is not kind nor cruel—it is simply itself, a voice that guides as much as it tests. It carried with it the scents of the Scorched Expanse and the Frozen Gloom, a warning of what lay beyond the twilight. It raged at times, tearing through their meager shelters, and at others it softened, offering respite in the form of cool breezes that carried seeds and whispers of unseen creatures.  

The First Ones listened. They built walls against the gales and learned the language of the land. They toiled under the ever-changing sky, learning to read the patterns of wind and cloud, finding sustenance in the harsh soil that begrudgingly gave its bounty. But the wind, as is its way, never rested. It tore down their walls and scattered their hard-won knowledge, forcing them to rebuild with greater care, with deeper understanding. Some among the First Ones cursed the wind, calling it a thief of peace, a force that mocked their struggles. Yet others, those who heard its deeper song, learned to shape their lives by its rhythm, to endure its trials and to thrive in its wake. These were the ones who began to see the wind not as an enemy but as a teacher.  

One tale speaks of a child born in those early days, a child with eyes the color of twilight and a voice that carried on the breeze. The wind is said to have spoken directly to her, teaching her to walk without sound and to hear the whispers of the world. She could stand still and listen to the hum of the stones beneath her feet, the sigh of sand as it shifted with the breeze, and the unspoken pulse of the twilight itself. Through her, the First Ones learned to listen, not only to the wind but to the breath of Duskara itself—the hum of stone, the sigh of sand, the pulse of the twilight. Her wisdom grew, and she became a guide, showing her people how to live in harmony with the wind’s song rather than fighting its will.  

Thus, it is said, the wind gave humanity its first gift: the power to listen. With this gift came survival, but also a warning. “I am the breath of this world,” the wind murmured. “I will guide you, but I will not coddle you. I will lift you, but I will not spare you. Remember this, and you will endure.” These words, though carried on the wind, were etched into the hearts of the First Ones, becoming the foundation of their resilience.  

The First Ones wove these words into their stories and carried them across generations. They spoke them aloud during the long nights when the wind howled outside their shelters, carved them into the walls of stone dwellings to withstand time, and etched them into sacred artifacts that bore the resonance of the twilight’s song. Through rituals that mirrored the ebb and flow of the wind itself, they preserved the lessons of the First Breath, ensuring that its melody would never be silenced. Their tales tell of the wind’s many faces: the gentle breeze that nurtures the seedlings, the tempest that tears away all that is weak, and the whisper that reveals the truths hidden in silence. And so the song of the First Breath lives on, carried by the eternal winds, reminding us that to survive is to listen, to adapt, and to honor the song of Duskara—the song that is never still, the song that began it all. The wind’s melody, ever-changing yet eternal, is the thread that binds us to this world, the breath that sustains us and the test that defines us.
