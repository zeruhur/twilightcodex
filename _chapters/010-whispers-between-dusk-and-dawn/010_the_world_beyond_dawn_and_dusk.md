*(From the Records of the Archivists, Codex Segment 137-A, Annotated by Korys Veldrin, Third Keeper of Twilight Chronicles)*  

Duskara, the great axis of our existence, is neither kind nor cruel. Its surface is a testament to unyielding balance—a tidally locked world where no force reigns unchallenged. On its sunward face, the Scorched Expanse burns with unrelenting heat, a land where stone melts and the air itself is a flame. This is a place of eternal agony, unfit for even the hardiest creatures. To the opposite lies the Frozen Gloom, where cold so absolute freezes life into stillness, preserving it as a graveyard of glacial monuments. Between these extremes stretches the Twilight Belt, a land of eternal half-light, where survival is both a relentless trial and a delicate art.  

It is in this precarious band of existence that we—humanity, the stubborn children of dust and starfire—have carved out our place. The wind, the most faithful chronicler of this world, is ever-moving, ever-whispering. Born from the collision of heat and cold, it scours the land, carrying not only the tangible detritus of existence but also intangible echoes, psychic currents that etch themselves into the bones of those who dwell here. It is said that the winds remember even what we would rather forget.  

The origins of humanity on Duskara remain shrouded in ambiguity, obscured by the erosion of time and the frailty of memory. Our oldest records—fragments more myth than fact—speak of a flight from destruction. They tell of ships descending from a sky now forgotten, burdened with the remnants of a people seeking refuge. What calamity drove them to this world? The Codex offers only theories: an apocalyptic war, a dying world, or perhaps a pursuit of something greater—a faith that Duskara’s twilight would cradle them in its strange rhythm of survival.  

In those early centuries, the settlers faced annihilation at every turn. The planet resisted them as much as it sustained them, a paradox woven into the fabric of this place. Storms tore through their camps; predators, both physical and unseen, thinned their numbers; and the alien psychic resonance of the Belt took its toll, bending minds and unearthing fears better left buried. Yet, against these odds, humanity endured.  

It was in this crucible that the first whispers of the psychic gift were heard—a mutation, some thought, brought on by Duskara’s unique atmosphere, or perhaps a response to its mysterious energies. At first, these abilities were rare and feared, considered curses or marks of imbalance. Over generations, however, they were honed and understood, becoming both a tool and a cornerstone of Duskaran culture. Today, these abilities are woven into the identities of the Belt’s people, used for survival, art, and even warfare.  

The struggle to retain knowledge during those early years was almost as dire as the battle for physical survival. The settlers brought with them archives of their old world—machines and records that should have lasted millennia. But the storms, the dust, and the psychic interference of the Belt corroded all things, physical and immaterial alike. It was from this desperation that the Archivists emerged, a caste born not of privilege but necessity, charged with preserving what little could be saved and committing the rest to memory.  

Our Codex is the culmination of this labor, a tapestry of truths, half-truths, and conjectures, stitched together with the care of generations. Within these pages lie the records of our origin, the details of our adaptation, and the ongoing chronicle of our resilience. Duskara, for all its hardships, has become our home—not by choice but by the tenacity of our will. Here, beneath the eternal twilight, we endure. Here, we write our story.
