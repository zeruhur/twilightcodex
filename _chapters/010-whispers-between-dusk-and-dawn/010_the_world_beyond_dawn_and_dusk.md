*(From the Records of the Archivists, Codex Segment 137-A, Annotated by Korys Veldrin, Third Keeper of Twilight Chronicles)*

Duskara breathes—not with lungs, but with the pulse of extremes. Its surface is a canvas of absolute contrasts: one face seared by an unrelenting sun that transmutes stone into liquid fire, the other a realm of glacial silence where motion itself freezes into eternal stillness. Between these savage landscapes lies the Twilight Belt, a delicate membrane of existence where humanity has sewn its fragile civilization.

We are not conquerors here, but negotiators—bargaining daily with a world that offers survival as a conditional mercy. The wind, our most eloquent chronicler, weaves between heat and cold, carrying more than mere particles. It bears psychic currents that whisper of forgotten histories, emotions etched into the very atmosphere, memories that seep into bone and blood.

Our arrival on this world remains a narrative shrouded in mist and speculation. Fragmentary records hint at a catastrophic exodus—ships descending from a forgotten sky, bearing the last fragments of a civilization in flight. Was it war that drove us? A dying world? Or something more profound—a desperate pilgrimage guided by an intuition that Duskara's twilight held a promise of rebirth?

Those initial centuries were a crucible of near-extinction. The planet tested us with storms that could shred hope itself, with predators both tangible and spectral, with a psychic landscape that could unravel minds like fragile threads. Yet we endured—not through might, but through an almost irrational resilience.

From this brutal landscape emerged our most extraordinary adaptation: the psychic gift. What began as rare, terrifying mutations gradually transformed into a sophisticated language of survival. These abilities became more than mere survival tools; they became the very DNA of our culture, woven into art, communication, and the delicate social fabric of the Twilight Belt.

Knowledge itself became our most precious and precarious resource. The archives we brought from our original home—intricate machines, detailed records—were devoured by Duskara's corrosive environment. In response, we birthed the Archivists, a caste not of privilege, but of desperate necessity. Our mission: to preserve, to remember, to resist forgetting.

This Codex is our testament—a tapestry of truths and half-truths, meticulously assembled across generations. It is more than a historical document; it is the living, breathing memory of a people who chose survival not as a triumph, but as a continuous negotiation with a world that both nurtures and threatens.

Duskara is not our home by choice, but by the stubborn poetry of our existence. Here, in the eternal twilight, we do not merely survive. We write our story, one whispered breath at a time.
