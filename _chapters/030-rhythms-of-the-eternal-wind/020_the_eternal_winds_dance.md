*(Echoes of the Wind, as transcribed by Lorekeeper Inaya of the Zephyr Clans)*  

Listen, children of the twilight, you who dwell where shadow and light entwine, to the song carried by the breath of the world. It is the dance of the Eternal Wind, weaving through time like a restless spirit. The winds know no beginning and no end, only the endless rhythm of their journey—a rhythm we honor and follow.

When the Stillwind comes, the world pauses. Communities retreat into quiet gatherings beneath the twilight sky, where they share stories of the past and weave plans for the future. Artisans mend tools and weave intricate patterns into windcloth, believing the stillness blesses their craft with resilience. Elders lead rituals of gratitude, placing offerings of twilight moss and polished stones at wind shrines, while children listen intently to the echoes of ancient tales whispered through the calm air. The air turns quiet, as though the wind herself has taken a moment to dream. In this stillness, we gather, we mend, and we listen to the whispers beneath the quiet—a promise that the dance will begin again. The Stillwind teaches us patience, the grace to find harmony in moments of rest.

Then comes the Galecrest, fierce and wild, its breath a roar that shakes the stones and bends the trees. Communities prepare by securing their dwellings with reinforced bindings and gathering in storm halls to share hearty meals and songs that honor the wind’s strength. Children race kites shaped like windbeasts, their laughter rising to meet the gale, while elders oversee the ritual of the Windbrace, fastening talismans to the tallest branches to invite the storm’s favor. It is a time of movement, a time to build, to venture, to chase the untamed paths of the wind. The Galecrest teaches us courage, the strength to embrace the storm and dance with its ferocity.

And when the Whispershift arrives, the wind softens, carrying secrets from far and near. Its touch is gentle, its voice a melody. Dreams come alive in this season; the boundaries between past and present blur, and the unseen becomes clear. The Whispershift teaches us reflection, the wisdom to hear the stories carried by the air and to add our own.

The Eternal Wind’s Dance is more than the turning of seasons. It is a sacred rhythm woven into the fabric of daily life, guiding both work and worship. In the mornings, farmers consult the wind's direction to determine planting cycles, while at dusk, weatherworkers offer chants to harmonize the air's flow. Spiritual practices mirror the wind's cycles, with prayers whispered during Whispershift to honor the wisdom carried in its gentler breezes, and bold dances performed under Galecrest's roar to channel its untamed energy into communal strength. It is the pulse of Duskara, the breath of a living world. From the depths of the Whispering Sands to the highest spires of the Auroral Cliffs, every soul moves to its rhythm. It binds us, it guides us, and it reminds us that we are but threads in its endless tapestry.

So, we sing to the wind, we walk with its steps, and we offer our stories to its currents. For the wind does not forget. It carries the voices of those who came before and whispers them to those yet to come. Elders often tell of the "Song of Lirian," a melody said to echo through the Whispering Sands on nights of the Stillwind. Lirian, a guide from ancient times, was lost to the storm but sang her final prayer into the gale. Her words, carried by the Eternal Wind, are said to resurface in moments of need, guiding travelers to safety and reminding all who hear that the wind keeps the stories of its children alive. Listen, children of the twilight, and join the Eternal Wind’s Dance.
