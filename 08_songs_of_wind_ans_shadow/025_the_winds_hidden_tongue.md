### **The Wind’s Hidden Tongue**  
*(Echoes of the Wind—A poem illustrating the beauty and complexity of the language, woven with imagery of wind and shadow.)*  

*Hush now, listen—*  
The wind speaks in ways unseen.  
Not in words, not in whispers,  
but in the hush of shifting sand,  
in the shudder of storm-struck trees,  
in the hush-hush hush of breath between lips.  

It is the language of ghosts and wanderers,  
of those who listen, those who wait,  
those who know the meaning of silence.  
Not all words are meant to be spoken,  
not all truths can bear the weight of a name.  

See how the dunes bend, curving in answer,  
how the stormroot trees bow but do not break.  
The wind does not ask, it does not beg,  
it moves, and so must we.  

In the high towers of Zephyrvale,  
the chimes tell stories in shifting notes—  
three beats for a coming storm,  
a falling tone for safe return.  
In the deep caves of Lumina,  
fingers trace meaning on skin,  
a language of pressure, of motion,  
felt but never seen.  

Watch the hands of the sand-runners,  
their quick flick of fingers,  
a warning, a greeting, a farewell.  
Listen to the breath of the night-watcher,  
a sharp inhale, a slow release—  
*a shadow moves, be still, be still.*  

We speak in wind and silence,  
in chime and gesture, in aurora glow.  
Our words are not just spoken,  
they are carried, shaped,  
dancing like dust in the dying light.  

*Hush now, listen—*  
The wind speaks,  
and we, if we are wise,  
speak back.
