### **Auroral Rites of Harmony**  
*(Pilgrim’s Almanac—Festival traditions tied to wind and auroras, told through a traveler’s eyes.)*  

**Cycle 891, Wind Phase: The Silent Drift**  
**Location: The Nightward Reaches, approaching Lumina Caverns**  

The wind at the edge of the world moves differently. It is not the howling breath of the Storm Walls, nor the steady push that guides traders through the twilight belt. Here, where the land leans toward the eternal night, the air carries silence. It does not rush; it lingers, as if listening for something just beyond hearing.  

I have come to witness the **Auroral Rites of Harmony**, the great festival held when the sky burns with shifting light. The Deepkin say the auroras are the planet’s dreams spilling into the heavens, the silent words of Duskara itself. For them, this is a time of reflection, of renewal, of listening to what the wind does not always say.  

### **The Arrival**  

I reached **Lumina Caverns** as the first tendrils of green shimmered in the night above. The journey had been long, marked by cold trails and the eerie glow of frostbloom moss. A pilgrim does not travel to Lumina alone—there is always someone ahead, someone behind, our paths weaving through the land like the auroras above.  

The **Rite of Arrival** is simple but essential. Before one enters the gathering, they must stand at the threshold of the caverns and breathe deeply three times—one breath for the past, one for the present, one for the path ahead. The elders say the wind carries these breaths into the world, stitching the traveler’s presence into the fabric of Duskara itself.  

I did as I was told. On the third breath, the wind stirred against my skin, though no storm was near.  

### **The Ritual of Light and Wind**  

The **Auroral Rites** are not a single ceremony, but a cycle of gestures, songs, and shared moments that last as long as the lights remain in the sky.  

The first is the **Dance of the Windward Souls**—performed in silence, save for the chimes that ring in the open air. Dancers move in slow, fluid steps, mirroring the movement of the auroras above. It is a meditation, a way of attuning oneself to the unseen forces that shape our world.  

Then comes the **Binding of the Breaths**, where travelers and Deepkin alike gather in a great circle. Each person exhales into the cupped hands of another, as if gifting their breath forward. The idea is simple: no one breathes alone. The air we take in has passed through countless lungs, across the length of the twilight belt, through generations unseen.  

The final rite is the **Offering to the Silent Sky**. At the peak of the auroras’ brilliance, small vessels of water—precious even in the caverns—are raised to the heavens, reflecting the light above. Each drop carries a promise: to endure, to listen, to carry the wind within.  

### **The Departure**  

As the auroras fade, so too does the gathering. There is no grand dismissal, no final proclamation. Pilgrims leave as they arrived, one by one, following the wind back to where they came. Some carry small vials of water blessed beneath the auroras; others take only the memory of the wind against their skin.  

I leave with both.  

And as I step beyond the caverns, the wind moves around me—not pushing, not pulling, but *guiding*.  

The elders say the auroras return when the world is ready to dream again. And so, I walk, knowing the sky will burn again, and the wind will call me back.
